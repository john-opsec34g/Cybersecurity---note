# SOC Analyst Labs & Investigations

This repository documents my hands-on learning journey as a **Junior SOC / Blue Team Analyst in training**.

The focus of this repository is not tool memorization, but:
- Alert triage and investigation
- Network and endpoint forensics
- Security decision-making
- Clear documentation and reasoning

## What you'll find here
- Realistic SOC-style investigations
- PCAP and log analysis walkthroughs
- Indicators of Compromise (IOCs)
- Defensive recommendations and lessons learned

## Skills Practiced
- Network traffic analysis (Wireshark)
- Web attack investigation
- Reverse shell detection
- Data exfiltration analysis
- Incident documentation

## Labs Platforms
- CyberDefenders
- Blue Team Labs

This repository is intended to demonstrate **how I think and investigate as a SOC analyst**, not just what tools I’ve seen.

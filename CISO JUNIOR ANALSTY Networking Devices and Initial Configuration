Networking Devices and Initial Configuration

Course Notes | Junior SOC / Blue Team Foundations

Overview

This repository documents my structured notes and hands-on understanding from the Networking Devices and Initial Configuration course, part of the Junior Cybersecurity Analyst career path.

The purpose of these notes is not to restate course material, but to connect core networking concepts to real-world security operations, incident investigation, and troubleshooting scenarios commonly encountered by SOC analysts.

Networking is the foundation of cybersecurity. Every alert, log, packet capture, or intrusion investigation relies on a solid understanding of how data moves across networks, how devices communicate, and where failures or abuse can occur.

Learning Objectives

Through this course and supporting labs, I focused on building the ability to:

Understand how modern networks are designed and structured

Configure and validate basic network devices

Analyze IP addressing and traffic flow

Identify normal vs abnormal network behavior

Relate networking concepts to security risks and attack techniques

Module 1: Network Design Fundamentals

This module introduced the principles behind reliable and secure network design.

Key Concepts

Fault Tolerance: Designing networks to continue functioning when components fail

Scalability: Ensuring networks can grow without performance degradation

Quality of Service (QoS): Prioritizing critical traffic

Network Security: Protecting data, devices, and communication paths

Hierarchical Network Design

Networks are typically divided into:

Access Layer – End devices connect here

Distribution Layer – Policy enforcement and routing

Core Layer – High-speed backbone

SOC relevance:
Understanding these layers helps analysts identify where an attack originates, where logs should exist, and which devices should be monitored during an incident.

Module 2: Cloud and Virtualization

This module explored how modern networks leverage cloud computing and virtualization.

Key Topics

Public, private, and hybrid cloud models

Virtual machines and hypervisors

Benefits of virtualization (isolation, scalability, cost efficiency)

SOC relevance:
Virtualized environments introduce shared infrastructure risks and require visibility across virtual networks, not just physical devices.

Module 3: Number Systems (Binary & Hexadecimal)

A strong focus was placed on understanding how computers interpret data.

Skills Developed

Binary-to-decimal and decimal-to-binary conversion

Understanding IPv4 addressing in binary

Hexadecimal representation used in MAC and IPv6 addresses

SOC relevance:
Packet analysis, subnetting, MAC address identification, and protocol decoding all rely on binary and hexadecimal understanding.

Module 4: Ethernet Switching

This module covered how data moves at Layer 2 of the OSI model.

Core Topics

Ethernet frame structure

MAC addressing (unicast, broadcast, multicast)

Switch learning and forwarding behavior

MAC address tables

SOC relevance:
Layer 2 attacks (ARP spoofing, MAC flooding) exploit how switches operate. Understanding switching behavior is essential for detecting lateral movement.

Module 5: The Network Layer

Focused on Layer 3 communication and IP behavior.

Key Concepts

IP encapsulation

Connectionless and best-effort delivery

IPv4 vs IPv6 packet structures

SOC relevance:
IP headers are critical during traffic analysis, routing investigations, and identifying spoofed or malformed packets.

Module 6: IPv4 Address Structure

Deep dive into how IPv4 addresses are constructed and used.

Topics Covered

Network vs host portions

Subnet masks and prefix length

Logical AND operations to determine networks

SOC relevance:
Understanding subnets helps analysts detect unauthorized devices, identify scanning behavior, and analyze segmentation failures.

Module 7: Address Resolution (ARP)

Explored how IP addresses are resolved to MAC addresses.

Key Topics

ARP request and reply process

ARP tables and caching

ARP-related security risks (ARP spoofing)

SOC relevance:
ARP poisoning is a common internal network attack used for credential theft and man-in-the-middle attacks.

Module 8: IP Addressing Services

Focused on DNS and DHCP, two critical infrastructure services.

DNS

Name resolution process

DNS hierarchy and queries

Using nslookup for troubleshooting

DHCP

Dynamic IP assignment

DHCP message flow (DORA)

SOC relevance:
DNS abuse and rogue DHCP servers are frequent attack vectors. DNS logs are a key data source in SOC investigations.

Module 9: Transport Layer (TCP & UDP)

Covered how applications communicate over networks.

TCP

Three-way handshake

Reliability, sequencing, flow control

Connection establishment and termination

UDP

Lightweight, connectionless communication

Common use cases (DNS, streaming, VoIP)

SOC relevance:
Port analysis, connection behavior, and protocol misuse detection rely on transport-layer understanding.

Module 10: Cisco IOS Command Line

Introduced the Cisco IOS CLI for device interaction.

Skills Practiced

Navigating IOS modes

Using show commands

Viewing interface and configuration data

SOC relevance:
Analysts often rely on network engineers’ output or device logs. Understanding IOS outputs improves collaboration and incident response accuracy.

Module 11: Building and Securing a Small Network

Hands-on configuration of switches and routers.

Activities Included

Basic device configuration

Enabling SSH for secure management

Configuring default gateways

Connectivity testing and troubleshooting

SOC relevance:
Misconfigurations are a major security risk. Knowing how devices should be configured helps identify weaknesses.

Module 12: ICMP and Network Testing

Focused on diagnostic tools and message types.

Key Tools

ping

traceroute

ICMP Messages

Destination unreachable

Time exceeded

SOC relevance:
ICMP traffic can indicate scanning, misconfigurations, or reconnaissance activity.

Key Takeaways for SOC Analysts

Networking fundamentals directly impact incident detection and response

Understanding traffic flow improves PCAP analysis

Many attacks exploit basic misconfigurations

Strong fundamentals reduce false positives during alert triage

📌 Overview

This repository documents my structured training in network defense and security operations fundamentals.
The course focuses on how enterprise networks are defended, monitored, and investigated, emphasizing defense-in-depth, alert evaluation, access control, firewall technologies, cryptography, and security monitoring.

Rather than theory alone, the training is lab-heavy, simulating real-world defensive tasks commonly performed by SOC Analysts, Network Security Engineers, and Blue Team operators.

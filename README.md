I am a Junior SOC / Blue Team Analyst in training with a strong interest in how real security operations work beyond theory and certifications.

My focus is on alert triage, incident investigation, and security decision-making, not just learning tools for their own sake. Through my learning journey, I’ve come to understand that effective SOC work is about context, reasoning, and prioritization under uncertainty.

I have completed the Microsoft SC-200 (Security Operations Analyst) learning path, AZ-900 (Azure Fundamentals), and the CISO Junior Analyst program, where I gained foundational knowledge in:

SOC workflows and escalation processes

Endpoint detection and response concepts

Threat and alert analysis

Security monitoring and incident documentation

Network and endpoint defense fundamentals

I am currently strengthening these skills through hands-on blue team labs, including CyberDefenders SOC labs and Blue Team Labs, where I practice:

Investigating suspicious activity

Differentiating false positives from true incidents

Analyzing logs, processes, and user behavior

Writing clear investigation notes and conclusions

I actively document my learning, lab work, and thought process in this GitHub repository to demonstrate how I think as a SOC analyst, not just what tools I’ve seen. My goal is to build practical, job-ready skills and prepare for remote SOC Level 1 roles or cybersecurity internships.

I am committed to continuous learning, disciplined practice, and developing the mindset required to work in a real Security Operations Centen

 CISO JUNIOR ANALYST Networking Basics — Deep-Dive Notes for Junior SOC Analysts

These notes document my in-depth learning from the Networking Basics course in the Junior Cybersecurity Analyst Career Path.

The goal of this documentation is to demonstrate conceptual understanding, security awareness, and investigative thinking, not just course completion.


1. Why Networking Matters in Cybersecurity

Every digital attack involves a network.
As a SOC analyst, I must understand:

How devices communicate

How data flows across networks

How attackers abuse protocols

How abnormal traffic differs from normal behavior

Without networking fundamentals, log analysis, SIEM alerts, PCAP investigations, and incident response are impossible to do well.


2. Module 1: Communication in a Connected World

2.1 Network Types

Local Area Network (LAN)

Small geographic area

High speed, low latency

Common in homes, offices, and campuses

Wide Area Network (WAN)

Connects multiple LANs

Slower than LANs

The internet is the largest WAN

Other Network Types

PAN: Personal devices (Bluetooth, wearables)

MAN: City-wide networks

Security relevance:

Helps determine if traffic is internal vs external

Critical for identifying data exfiltration paths


2.2 Data Transmission

Data is split into packets

Packets travel independently

Reassembled at the destination

Transmission methods:

Unicast: One sender → one receiver

Broadcast: One sender → all devices

Multicast: One sender → selected group

SOC relevance:

Excessive broadcast traffic may indicate misconfigurations or ARP attacks

Unexpected multicast traffic can signal malware activity


2.3 Bandwidth vs Throughput

Bandwidth: Maximum possible data rate

Throughput: Actual successful data transfer

Low throughput despite high bandwidth may indicate:

Network congestion

Packet loss

Malicious traffic interference


3. Module 2: Network Components, Types, and Connections

3.1 Clients and Servers

Client

Initiates requests

Examples: browser, email app

Server

Responds to requests

Examples: web server, DNS server, mail server

SOC relevance:

Servers should behave predictably

A client acting like a server may indicate compromise


3.2 Network Components
Device	Function	Security Relevance
Switch	Forwards frames within LAN	Lateral movement analysis
Router	Routes traffic between networks	External traffic analysis
Firewall	Filters traffic	First line of defense
Access Point	Wireless connectivity	Rogue AP detection
NIC	Network interface	MAC-level tracking
3.3 ISP Connectivity Options

Fiber

DSL

Cable

Wireless

Understanding ISP connections helps during:

Incident escalation

External attack attribution

Traffic source validation

4. Module 3: Wireless and Mobile Networks

4.1 Wireless Networks

Use radio signals

Governed by IEEE 802.11 standards

Vulnerable to interception if misconfigured


4.2 Mobile Connectivity

Cellular data

Public Wi-Fi

Security risks:

Man-in-the-Middle (MITM)

Rogue access points

Weak encryption

5. Module 4: Building a Home Network

5.1 Home Network Basics

Router acts as:

Gateway

DHCP server

NAT device

End devices connect via Ethernet or Wi-Fi

5.2 Wireless Standards

Affect speed

Affect range

Affect security capabilities

5.3 Router Configuration

IP address assignment

Wireless security

Admin access control

SOC relevance:
Many real-world breaches begin with poor network configuration.

6. Module 5: Communication Principles

6.1 Communication Protocols

Protocols define:

How data is formatted

How it is transmitted

How errors are handled

6.2 Communication Standards

Ensure interoperability

Prevent vendor lock-in


6.3 Network Communication Models

OSI Model (7 Layers)

Physical

Data Link

Network

Transport

Session

Presentation

Application

TCP/IP Model

Application

Transport

Internet

Network Access

SOC mindset:
Attacks can be mapped to specific layers.

7. Module 6: Network Media

7.1 Media Types

Copper (Ethernet)

Fiber optics

Wireless

Each affects:

Speed

Reliability

Eavesdropping risk

8. Module 7: The Access Layer

8.1 Encapsulation and Ethernet Frames

Data wrapped with headers

Includes source and destination MAC addresses

8.2 Access Layer Function

Device-to-device communication

Switching logic

Security relevance:

MAC spoofing

ARP poisoning

Unauthorized device access

9. Module 8: Internet Protocol (IPv4)

9.1 Purpose of IPv4

Logical device identification

Enables routing across networks


9.2 IPv4 Structure

32-bit address

Divided into:

Network portion

Host portion

SOC analysts rely heavily on IP addresses in:

SIEM alerts

Firewall logs

Threat intelligence

10. Module 9: IPv4 and Network Segmentation
10.1 IPv4 Address Types

Public vs Private

Static vs Dynamic


10.2 Network Segmentation

Benefits:

Limits attacker movement

Improves performance

Enhances monitoring

Segmentation failures often lead to large-scale breaches.

11. Module 10: IPv6 Addressing

11.1 IPv4 Limitations

Address exhaustion

Increased NAT complexity

11.2 IPv6 Advantages

Larger address space

Simplified routing

SOC relevance:
IPv6 traffic must be monitored to avoid visibility gaps.

12. Module 11: Dynamic Addressing with DHCP

12.1 Addressing Types

Static: Fixed

Dynamic: Assigned automatically

12.2 DHCP Process (DORA)

Discover

Offer

Request

Acknowledge

Security risks:

Rogue DHCP servers

Address exhaustion attacks

13. Module 12: Gateways and NAT
13.1 Network Boundaries

Separate internal from external networks

13.2 NAT

Translates private IPs to public IPs

Adds a layer of obscurity

SOC challenge:
NAT complicates incident attribution.

14. Module 13: Address Resolution Protocol (ARP)

14.1 MAC and IP Mapping

ARP resolves IP → MAC

Uses broadcast messages

14.2 Security Implications

ARP spoofing

Man-in-the-Middle attacks

ARP traffic analysis is critical during internal investigations.

15. Module 14: Routing Between Networks

15.1 Routing Purpose

Enables inter-network communication

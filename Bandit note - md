🛡️ OverTheWire Bandit Notes (Levels 1–10)

These are my detailed notes while solving the Bandit wargame on OverTheWire.
The game is designed to teach Linux basics, file manipulation, and security concepts — essential skills for cybersecurity.




🔑 Level Notes

Level 1 → 2

Task: Password is in a file called -.

Command:

ls
cat ./-

✅ Learned how to handle tricky filenames starting with - by prefixing with ./.

Level 4 → 5

Task: The password is in one human-readable file among many.

Command:

cd inhere
file ./*
cat ./-file07

✅ Learned how to identify readable files using file.





Level 5 → 6

Task: Find the file with specific properties:

human-readable

1033 bytes in size

not executable


Command:

find . -type f -size 1033c ! -executable
cat ./<filename>

✅ Learned how to use find with filters (-size, ! -executable).




Level 6 → 7

Task: Password is stored in /etc/bandit_pass/bandit7.
But you don’t know the exact filename.

Command:

find / -user bandit7 -group bandit6 -size 33c 2>/dev/null
cat /var/lib/dpkg/info/bandit7.password

Endpoint Security 

Course: Endpoint Security
Duration: 27 Hours
Labs Completed: 31
Level: Beginner → SOC Foundations
Focus: Endpoint Defense, OS Security, Network Attacks, Threat Mitigation

📌 Overview

This course provided hands-on foundational training in endpoint security, operating systems, network defense, and threat mitigation. The curriculum focused on defending systems at the network edge, where attacks most frequently occur, and emphasized real-world attack techniques, vulnerabilities, and defensive controls used by Security Operations Centers (SOC).

Through theory, labs, and simulations, I developed practical skills in endpoint hardening, threat detection, system monitoring, and incident prevention across Windows, Linux, wired, and wireless environments.

🔐 Cybersecurity Principles Applied

Confidentiality, Integrity, Availability (CIA Triad)

Data protection (at rest, in transit, in use)

Security policies, standards, and procedures

Defense-in-depth strategies

🧠 Key Takeaways

Most breaches start at the endpoint

Misconfigurations are as dangerous as malware

Monitoring + hardening = reduced attack surface

SOC analysts must understand both attacks and defenses

Logs and endpoints tell the full incident story

📈 How This Prepares Me for a SOC Role

This training strengthened my ability to:

Investigate endpoint alerts

Analyze logs and suspicious behavior

Identify attack patterns

Recommend mitigation strategies

Support incident response workflows
